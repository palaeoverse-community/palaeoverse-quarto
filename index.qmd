**Palaeoverse** is an initiative which aims to bring the palaeobiology community together to share resources, reach agreed standards, and improve reproducibility in palaeobiological research.

We are currently focused on developing:

- R Packages: community tools to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility
- Directory: An online community database of research labs, upcoming conferences, workshops, and vacancies around the world
- GrantTrack: An online community database of research funding schemes and grants for palaeobiologists
- Google Group: A community space for palaeobiologists to share ideas and resources, advertise opportunities, and network with colleagues in an informal setting.
