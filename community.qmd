We host a community space for palaeobiologists using the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/palaeoverse" style="text-decoration: none">**Google Groups**</a> platform. This space provides an area to share ideas and resources, advertise opportunities, and network with colleagues in an informal setting. Questions related to <a href="./package.qmd" style="text-decoration: none">**palaeoverse packages**</a> are also welcome. The group is unmoderated, but it is a space for all so as always be kind and respectful to others. Harrassment of individuals will result in removal from the group.
