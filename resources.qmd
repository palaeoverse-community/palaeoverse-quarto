The <a href="https://palaeoverse.org" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">**palaeoverse package**</a> cheat sheet is designed to make your life easier when working with the package. It serves as a quick look-up guide on the functionality available, grouped by categories. From time to time, we will add additional cheat sheets for packages from the Palaeoverse development team, and update current ones as packages evolve.
